# Show Label Color

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays the Label Color for each glyph in the edit tab. For ALL glyphs. What a nice thing to have.

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon). Double click the .reporter file and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp to install. Or copy the `ShowNodeCount.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Rotated` from the view menu.
