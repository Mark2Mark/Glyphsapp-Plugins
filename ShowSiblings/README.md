# Show Siblings

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays a group of predefined glyphs in the background of your letters. This can be both pretty helpful in the beginning of a design as well as at intermediate progress where quick proof overview is needed. The degree of a desired match depends on each design, of course.

### How to use

copy the `ShowSiblings.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Siblings` from the view menu.

### Default groups

The default groups are as follows and can be customized in the `Contents/Resources/ShowSiblings.py`, search for the *defaultSiblings* dictionary.
```
c e o
b p
d q
h n r l
i j
t f
k x
v y
B D P R
C G O Q
H U N
K V X Y
```
